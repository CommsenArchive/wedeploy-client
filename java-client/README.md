This is unofficial Java client library for WeDeploy! 

[WeDeploy](https://wedeploy.com) provides a set of ready-to-use services that enables you to store data in the cloud, search and stream content in real time, authenticate users, send e-mails to your users and so much more!

This client allows Java applications to talk to WeDeploy cloud services as if those were local ones.

See [project site](https://azzazzel.github.io/wedeploy-client) for more details!
